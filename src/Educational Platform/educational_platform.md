# A Peer-to-Peer Educational Platform 

![](img/Education_for_all.jpeg)

To open-up more possibilities for learning and positive solution for our world, Take Action Global envison to create a fully peer-to-peer educational platform which will be built on top of Digital Twin. This will give the possibility to connect millions of students and teachers together on a peer-to-peer way. This will enable the setting up of global projects to tackle climate change and other issues and allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take actions - A Climate Education for all!

Each student and teacher will be gifted with a Digital Twin for Life that will grant them a unique digital identity forever while being in a fully private and secured digital world - They will have full control over their data, no one else. 

By being built on top of Digital Twin, students and teachers will be able to use the seamless experiences such as Meet, to collaborate with each other. 

> The Education Platform is under production and will be available soon.
