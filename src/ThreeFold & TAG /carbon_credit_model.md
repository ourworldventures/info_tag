# Carbon Credit Model 

Following ThreeFold new Farming model along with the introduction to Planet Positive Farmer and Planet Friendly Farmer, we will now explore how the carbon credits are created and how will they be used to support directly climate action projects.

**Process**: 

1. Contribution Phase: Users and Farmers 

Users of the ThreeFold Grid will pay in ThreeFold Token (TFT) to run and store their data. In the selling price, x% of the proceeds will be allocated, by ThreeFold Foundation to offset the users' energy footprint. 

Farmers who will provide capacity and storage on the ThreeFold Grid, will be rewarded in TFT, by ThreeFold Foundation, under the process of cultivation. Part of the reward will be transparently reallocated, by ThreeFold Foundation, to offset the farmers' energy footprint. 

2. Conversion Phase 

The TFTs retained, from Contribution Phase, will be converted into TFT_TAG, which is a whitelabel of TFT and, not exchangeable on public exchanges yet. 

3. First Part: TFT_TAG converted into Fiat Currency for Students

In order to provide the amount of money required to support students or children from all around the world in taking action against climate change (for instance, planting trees), ThreeFold Foundation will buy the TFT_TAG for Fiat Currency. The purpose here, is to reward directly students and children and support their education. 

Firstly, a first portion of the total amount will be sent to the students to buy everything which is needed for the action to be completed. Then, after receiving the audit approval, the rest of the total amount will be sent to the students as a reward. 

4. Second Part: TFT_TAG For Take Action Global and Community auditors 

To be fully trustworthy and transparent process, community members of the current region will be voluntarily assigned as community auditors - They will be the ones who will check the truthfulness of the actions and provide a report for all the stakeholders of ThreeFold and Take Action Global. 

For instance, community auditors will make sure that the tree has been planted and if it is the right plant according to the biodiversity of the environment & its carbon absorption rate. 

They will be rewarded by TFT_TAG.
