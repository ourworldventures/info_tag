Despite ThreeFold infrastructure designed in a way to be super energy efficient compared to the current market, Threefold join forces with Take Action Global to let students farm carbon credits. 

We, ThreeFold has the aim to take two times more carbon out of the air than we put in. 

ThreeFold will now support TAG students for taking concrete action against climate change, by rewarding, in fiat currency, the children and contributing also for their educational expenses. We wanted to tackle our carbon footprint from a different angle where we will get involved directly with the children.

Actions such planting different types of trees according to the environment biodiversity and the carbon absorption rate, cleaning up the waste plastic in the community's neighboordhood or on beaches. Even a small effort can have a tremendous positive impact on our planet. 

This project has the potential to offset 100% of our energy usage by end 2021.

## Education 

To open up more possibilities for learning and positive solution for our world, TAG envison to create a peer-to-peer educational platform which will be built on top of the Threefold Grid. This platform will be a way to connect students to students, students to teachers, and teachers to teachers. 

Additionally, each student and teacher will be granted a Digital Twin for Life (their unique digital identity providing them with a fully private and secure digital life) along with its seamless collaborative experiences. From that, we will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing sutdents to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action.
