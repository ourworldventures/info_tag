# Carbon Footprint Tacking App 

Built on top of Digital Twin, a Carbon Tracking experience will be available for its users to track their carbon footprint from different activities. Users will be able to know, according to their actions, whether they have made great progress regarding climate change or if some additional effort is needed - they will even be able to track their progress according to the rest of world.  

Users will be rewarded in relation to their actions and may also support financially students/climate actors/children from all around the world and thus, offsetting much more their carbon footprint on this planet. We are all taking our responsibility towards climate change and supporting each one of us.

To open-up more possibilities for learning and positive solution for our world, Take Action Global envison to create a fully peer-to-peer educational platform which will be built on top of Digital Twin. This will give the possibility to connect millions of students and teachers together on a peer-to-peer way. It enables the setting up of global projects to tackle climate change and other issues and allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take actions - A Climate Education for all!

Each student and teacher will be gifted with a Digital Twin for Life that will grant them a unique digital identity forever while being in a fully private and secured digital world - They will have full control over their data, no one else. 

By being built on top of Digital Twin, students and teachers will be able to use the seamless experiences such as Meet, to collaborate with each other. 

> The Education Platform is under production and will be available soon.
