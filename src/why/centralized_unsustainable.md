# Decentralization of Digital Infrastructure

The current Internet [consumes about 10% of global energy production](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255923829_Emerging_Trends_in_Electricity_Consumption_for_Consumer_ICT). With the imminent boom of emerging technologies such as edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, Artificial Intelligent and Virtual Reality, the Internet’s energy consumption is [expected to increase exponentially](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2017-02-07-gartner-says-8-billion-connected-things-will-be-in-use-in-2017-up-31-percent-from-2016).

Today, more than 80% of the Internet’s capacity is owned by centralized cloud providers. The capacity is derived from hyper-scale data centres - an incredibly costly infrastructure, not scalable and super unsustainable. As of today, the Internet consumes about 10% of global energy resources.

The current industry's solutions focus on increasing the use of renewable energies to power data centers. However this is not a viable solution as data centers consume enormous amounts of energy. Therefore, a new solution that can drastically reduce the global Internet’s energy consumption is needed.
